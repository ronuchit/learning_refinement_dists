\section{Related Work}
Prior work has been devoted to using machine learning techniques for
training heuristics to guide search algorithms. This general formulation
has been applied to many domains, such as large-scale optimization~\cite{Boyanlearning},
solving constraint satisfication problems~\cite{hamadisearch}, and controlling state-space beam
search in classical task planners~\cite{Xu07discriminativelearning}. To our knowledge, our work is the
first to combine reinforcement learning with a task and motion planning
system, in order to find good proposal distributions for grounding a symbolic
plan.
