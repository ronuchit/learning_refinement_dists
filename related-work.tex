\section{Related Work}
Our approach builds directly from recent work in fully observed combined
task and motion planning. (More related works about this?)
We employ reinforcement learning techniques first applied by Zucker et al.
to sampling-based motion planners. Their approach uses workspace features to
discover good distributions for configuration space sampling. In our system,
we adapt their method of training a weight vector $\theta$ for these workspace features.
TODO: this section needs major improvement
