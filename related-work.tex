\section{Related Work}
Prior work has been devoted to using machine learning techniques for
training heuristics to guide search algorithms. This general formulation
has been applied to many domains.

Boyan et al.~\cite{Boyanlearning} present an application to solving optimization
problems using local search routines. They describe an algorithm, \textsc{Stage},
for learning a state evaluation function using features of the optimization problem.
This function then guides the local search toward better optima.

Arbelaez et al.~\cite{hamadisearch} use machine learning to solve constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs). Their approach, Continuous Search, maintains a heuristic
model for solving CSPs and alternates between two modes. In the \emph{exploitation} mode,
the current heuristic model is used to solve user-inputted CSPs. In the \emph{exploration}
mode, this model is refined using supervised learning with a linear SVM.

Xu et al.~\cite{Xu07discriminativelearning} apply machine learning for classical task
planning. They draw inspiration from recent advances in discriminative learning for
structured output classification. Their system trains heuristics for controlling forward
state-space beam search in task planners.

To our knowledge, our work is the first to use reinforcement learning for plan refinement
in a task and motion planning system.
