\section{Related Work}
Our work uses machine learning techniques to improve planning reliability in a TAMP system.

Kaelbling et al.~\cite{kaelbling2011hierarchical} use hand-coded ``geometric suggesters'' to propose
continuous geometric values for the plan parameters. These suggesters are heuristic
computations which map information about the robot type and geometric operators to a restricted
set of values to sample for each plan parameter. Our methods could be adapted here to learn these
suggesters.

Lagriffoul et al.~\cite{lagriffoul2014orientation}
propose a set of geometric constraints involving the kinematics and sizes of the specific objects of
interest in the environment. These constraints then define a feasible region from which to search
for geometric instantiations of plan parameters. Our approach could be adapted to learn generalized
versions of these constraints that apply to various domains.

Garrett et al.~\cite{GarrettWAFR14} use information about reachability in the robot configuration
space and symbolic state space to construct a \emph{relaxed plan graph} that guides motion
planning queries, using geometric biases to break ties among states with the same heuristic value.
By contrast, we allow RL to shape distributions for motion planning queries, so reachability information
is naturally incorporated.

Another line of work has been devoted to using machine learning techniques for
training heuristics to guide search algorithms. This general formulation
has been applied to many domains other than hierarchical planning for robotics.

Boyan et al.~\cite{Boyanlearning} present an application to solving optimization
problems using local search routines. They describe an algorithm, \textsc{Stage},
for learning a state evaluation function using features of the optimization problem.
This function then guides the local search toward better optima.

% Arbelaez et al.~\cite{hamadisearch} use machine learning to solve constraint
% satisfaction problems (CSPs). Their approach, Continuous Search, maintains a heuristic
% model for solving CSPs and alternates between two modes. In the \emph{exploitation} mode,
% the current heuristic model is used to solve user-inputted CSPs. In the \emph{exploration}
% mode, this model is refined using supervised learning with a linear SVM.

Xu et al.~\cite{Xu07discriminativelearning} apply machine learning for classical task
planning, drawing inspiration from recent advances in discriminative learning for
structured output classification. Their system trains heuristics for controlling forward
state-space beam search in task planners.

To our knowledge, our work is the first to use machine learning to guide search in a TAMP system.
