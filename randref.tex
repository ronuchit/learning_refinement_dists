\section{A Randomized Algorithm for Refinement}
As noted in the previous section, we can use a variety of algorithms to implement
plan refinement. Since we want to apply RL to learn policies for refinement,
we seek an algorithm that allows for easy formulation as an MDP. Our method
imitates that of Zhang and Dietterich~\cite{JobShopSched}:
we initialize an infeasible refinement and use a randomized local search to propose
improvements. Alg.\,\ref{alg:randref} shows pseudocode for this randomized refinement,
which implements \textsc{NDGetInstantiation} and \textsc{GetError} in Alg.\,\ref{alg:complete},
 and fixes \textsc{NDChoice} as \emph{error} in line 4 of \textsc{AddChild}.

The algorithm takes as input a high-level plan and a maximum iteration count.
In line 1, we initialize a (potentially invalid) refinement by sampling values for symbolic references
from their corresponding distributions, which can be hand-coded or learned, as described in Section VI. We continue sampling
until we find bindings that satisfy inverse kinematics constraints (IK feasibility). Trajectories are
initialized as straight lines.

  \nl $failStep, failPred \leftarrow $\textsc{MotionPlan}($HLP$)\;
  \nl \If {$failStep$ == NULL} {
  \tcc{\footnotesize Found valid plan refinement.}
  \nl return success }
  \nl \ElseIf {$failPred$ == NULL} {
  \tcc{\footnotesize Motion planning failure.}
  \nl $failAction \leftarrow HLP.ops[failStep]$\;
  \nl \textsc{Resample}($failAction.params$) }
  \nl \Else {
  \tcc{\footnotesize Action precondition violation.}
  \nl \textsc{Resample}($failPred.params$) } }
  \nl Raise failure to task planner, receive new plan. }
\end{small}

\end{algorithm}

The \textsc{MotionPlan} subroutine called in line 3 attempts to
find a collision-free set of trajectories linking all pose instantiations.
To do so, it iterates through the sequence of actions that comprise the high-level plan.
For each, it first calls the motion planner to find a trajectory
linking the sampled poses. If this succeeds, it tests the action preconditions;
as part of this step, it checks that the trajectory is collision-free.

If \textsc{MotionPlan} is unsuccessful, it returns into $failStep$ the index of the action where failure occurred.
If this was due to a motion planning failure, $failPred$ is NULL. Otherwise,
the violated action precondition is stored into $failPred$.
We then call the \textsc{Resample} routine on the symbolic parameters
associated with the failure; this routine picks one of these at random and
resamples its value.

Randomized refinement has two key properties. The first is a very explicit algorithm state.
We show in the next section that this allows for a straightforward MDP
formulation. This is also beneficial from an
engineering perspective, as the simplicity allows for easy debugging. The second is that
it allows the instantiations for a particular action in
the plan to be influenced by those for a \emph{future} action. For example, in a
pick-and-place task, it can make sense for the object's grasp pose to be sampled
conditionally on the current instantiation of the putdown pose, even though the putdown
appears after the grasp in the plan sequence. Thus, it is easy for plan refinement to
respond to long-term dependencies in continuous values of symbolic references.
