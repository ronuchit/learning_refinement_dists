Description:
This video supplements "Guided Search for Task and Motion Plans Using Learned Heuristics." It shows sample executions of the low-level learning in all 3 domains: the can domain, the dinner domain, and the frying domain. For each domain, we first show why a backtracking baseline can fail to achieve good results. We then plot our learned refinement distributions and demonstrate that they lead to much faster planning times.
