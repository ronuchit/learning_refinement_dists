\section{Introduction}
A long-term goal of robotics research is the introduction of
intelligent household robots.  To be effective, such robots will need
to perform complex tasks over long horizons (e.g., setting a dinner
table, doing laundry). Planning for these long-horizon tasks is
infeasible for state-of-the-art motion planners, making the need for a
hierarchical system of reasoning apparent.

One way to approach hierarchical planning is through combined
\emph{task and motion planning} (TAMP). In this approach, an agent is
given a symbolic, logical characterization of actions (e.g., move,
grasp, putdown), along with a geometric encoding of the
environment. TAMP systems maintain a hierarchical separation of
high-level, symbolic task planning and low-level, geometric motion
planning.  Efficient integration of these two types of reasoning is
difficult, and recent research has proposed several methods for
it~\cite{srivastava2014combined, kaelbling2011hierarchical,
  lagriffoul2014orientation, GarrettWAFR14, dornhege2012semantic}.
We adopt the principles of abstraction in the TAMP system developed by
Srivastava et al.~\cite{srivastava2014combined} (henceforth referred
to as SFRCRA-14) to factor the reasoning and search problems into
interacting logic-based and geometric components.

In this work, we develop a complete algorithm for TAMP and propose
methods for jointly carrying out guided search in the space of
high-level (logic-based) plans and their low-level
\emph{refinements}, instantiations of continuous values for
symbolic references in the plan. We refer to this search for a valid low-level
refinement as \emph{plan refinement}.

Our complete algorithm introduces
a \emph{plan refinement graph}, a data structure that stores a
set of qualitatively different high-level plans that could solve a task.
During planning, we repeatedly select one such plan and either try to
refine it or incorporate geometric information to generate a new high-level
plan. This allows interleaving plan refinement with a
search over \emph{which} high-level plan to try refining, given options
that address different infeasibilities.

We present machine learning techniques to train heuristic functions that guide
both of these search processes. At the high level, this amounts to learning
to predict how difficult it is to refine a given plan. At the low level, this amounts to
learning to propose continuous values for symbolic references that are likely to result in
collision-free trajectories. Many TAMP systems rely on hand-coded heuristics to
account for these continuous parameter settings. This often requires
domain-specific insight from the user to reduce the space of possible values.
We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to learn domain-specific distributions
over these values in a domain-independent fashion.

Our learning approach draws inspiration
from Zhang and Dietterich~\cite{JobShopSched}, who applied RL to job
shop scheduling. In their formulation, states correspond to schedules
and actions propose changes to the schedule. In our setting, states
correspond to (potentially infeasible) refinements and actions propose
new values for symbolic references.

The contributions of our work are as follows: 1) we present a complete
algorithm for TAMP by maintaining a plan refinement graph; 2) we
present a local search algorithm for plan refinement that is easily
formulated as an MDP; 3) we formulate plan refinement in the RL
framework and learn a policy for this MDP; 4) we train heuristics to
search intelligently through a plan refinement graph; and 5) we
present experiments to evaluate our approach in a variety of simulated
domains. Our results demonstrate that our approach yields
significantly improved performance over that of SFRCRA-14.
