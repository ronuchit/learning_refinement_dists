Abstract
--------

"To do so, these systems....domain specificity; however, this
approach" --> "To account for continuous parameters, many of these
systems rely on hand-coded discretizations of the domain. Such an
approach..."

"We formulate plan refinement" --> "Our approach first plans
abstractly, ignoring continuous values and then performs \emph{plan
refinement} to determine feasible parameter settings. We formulate this process"

"We also train heuristics...focus refinement" --> "We also present
intial work that learns which plan, from a set of potential
candidates, to refine."

Introduction
------------

"Both the task planner" --> "An advantage of this system is that the task planner"

Move the reinforcement learning paragraph to be before the plan
refinement graph paragraph. This way the structure is

  1. Explanation of the existing system
  2. talk about approach to low-level learning
  3. brief paragraph on high-level learning
