Abstract
--------------------

"In our work, we formulate this" --> "We formulate plan refinement"

"We find that .... sampling distributions." --> "We show improvements
in success rate and planning time over a hand-coded baseline."

"complex tasks ... horizons" -- move parens to after "horizons"

"The hierarchical separation of high-level...the overall goal." -- I
don't think this is true of all task and motion planning solutions,
just Srivastava et al. Remove or integrate into next paragraph

", but they can be...above. In this system" --> "; similar approaches could be
applied for TAMP approaches cited above. In Srivastava et al."

"The system presented by Srivastava..." -- I think we can remove this

"requires substantial effort, ... based on" --> "often requires
substantial effort. They typically depend on"

"its objects, meaning ... when running" --> "its objects and must be
recalibrated to run"

Background
-------------

"an action, causing" --> "an action. This causes"

"transition according" --> "change according"

"Formally, an MDP is ...$\rangle$" --> "We define an MDP as ... $\rangle$, where"

Put commas around defintiion: Ex "a policy, $\pi: S\rightarrow A$, that maps"

Paragraph starting "Classical task planners" is too long, split into at least 2 Ps

Learning Refinement Distributions
------------------------------------

"We note that randomized refinement ... suggest x" -- flip the order
on these? seems like the logic goes the other way...

Experiments
-----------

"Thus, they are not .... This means ...performs well" --> "Depth first
search can be expected to perform well in this setting because error
information is independent of continuous paramter values."

"we simply train" --> "we train"
