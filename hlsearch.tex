\section{Learning to Search the Plan Refinement Graph}
The approach presented thus far can be succinctly described as learning \emph{how} to
refine a single high-level plan. In this section, we present a method for learning
\emph{which} plan to try refining. Recall that in Alg.\,\ref{alg:complete}, the high
level has a two-tiered decision to make: which node in the plan refinement graph to
visit next, and whether to attempt to refine this node or generate failure information
from it. These decisions are encoded in the routines \textsc{NDGetNextNode}
and \textsc{NDChoice} in line 4 of the main algorithm. In this section, we show how
to train heuristics that implement these routines. The heuristics are trained to estimate
the difficulty associated with refining a plan, and accordingly decide to generate
a geometric fact to use for replanning.
