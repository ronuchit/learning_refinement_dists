\section{Limitations and Future Work}
A major limitation of our system is the hand-coded features. In future work, we
plan to move toward learned features, which offer more complex policy classes. Along the same
lines, we hope to consider features of the logical structure of the high-level plan, perhaps
using a kernelized method that applies to strings. We also plan to experiment with more
sample-efficient {\sc rl} algorithms.

Another limitation is the lack of variation among samples in the learned refinement distributions;
we observed that similar poses were often sampled repeatedly. To address
this, we could incentivize exploring new regions of the sample space during training.
