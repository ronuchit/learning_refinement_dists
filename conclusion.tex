\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel application of reinforcement learning to task
and motion planning. We gave a randomized local search algorithm for plan refinement
and trained policies for it. We also showed initial work that trains heuristics
for searching the plan refinement graph, so our full system learns both \emph{which} node to refine
and \emph{how} to perform this refinement. We evaluated performance against a baseline
of hand-coded discretizations for several challenging tasks; our system demonstrated
significantly improved performance.
