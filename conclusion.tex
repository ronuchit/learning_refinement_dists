\section{Conclusion}
We presented a complete algorithm for {\sc tamp}. We then applied machine learning to train
continuous proposal distributions for plan refinement and search intelligently through
a plan refinement graph. Thus, our full system learns both \emph{which} node to refine
and \emph{how} to perform the refinement. We evaluated performance against {\sc sfrcra-14} in
several challenging tasks; our system demonstrated significantly improved performance.
