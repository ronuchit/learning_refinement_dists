\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel application of reinforcement learning to task
and motion planning. We trained policies for refining symbolic plans
by learning good sampling distributions for plan parameters. The choice
of which parameter to resample at each iteration was governed by randomized refinement,
a local search algorithm we presented for plan refinement. We also showed initial work that trains heuristics
for searching the plan refinement graph, so our full system learns both \emph{which} node to refine
and \emph{how} to perform this refinement. We evaluated performance against a baseline
of hand-coded discretizations for several challenging tasks. Our system demonstrated
significantly improved performance.
