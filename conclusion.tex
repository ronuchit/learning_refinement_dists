\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel application of reinforcement learning to plan refinement in task
and motion planning. Our method trained a policy for refining symbolic plans
by learning good sampling distributions for plan parameters. The choice
of which parameter to resample at each iteration was governed by randomized refinement,
a local search algorithm we presented for plan refinement. We additionally trained heuristics
for search through the plan refinement graph, so our full system learns both \emph{which} node to refine
and \emph{how} to perform this refinement. We evaluated
performance by comparing against a baseline of hand-coded discretizations
for several challenging tasks, in which our system demonstrated significantly
improved performance.
